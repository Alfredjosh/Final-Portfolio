<h1> What did my reflection show? </h1>
<p> Second Quarter went way better than I thought it would be, in a way it was 
easier for me to understand the lessons.
I don't really know the reason, however I think it's because of my first quarter 
knowledge, that made this quarter much much easier.<br>
Now I did have a confusing time with the span and div tags but in the end 
I was able to pull through. I think the most difficult lesson was either 4 or 5.<br>
And finally though we didn't have much time for lessons when we did, Miss Uminga 
never fails to deliver. I would like to thank her once again for her efforts in
teaching Grade-9 Fidelity. </p>
